# Vue.js Tic Tac Toe Game

> i-ology interview challenge

## Introduction

This was my first experience using the Vue.js framework for Web Development. Vue is unique to other frameworks because it allows you to create individual components (similar to React) and tether them together to a single application. Vue differs from other frameworks because it allows you to create each components Template, Style, and Logic all within each file.

The game does not have a computer function, as my limited time and knowledge of Vue didn't permit added AI capability. After O places their tile, the clicker will render X on the next click. Two player is confined to a single browser.

## Running Locally
In your terminal, enter:

> git clone https://github.com/misterfoxy/vue_TicTacToe.git

> cd vue_TicTacToe

> npm run dev

This will start the application on localhost:8080


## Challenges Faced

This was a unique challenge for me, as I had never used Vue prior to this challenge. First, I read through the documentation on the Vue website. Following this, I searched through a handful of Github projects, and observed source code to help get familiar with project structure.

I utilized Youtube tutorials to get familiar with Syntax and logic, but still wouldn't say I'm proficient with this technology. However, I am very open to using it in the future, as it is very versitile and simple in nature.

I commented throughout the project for readibility, maintenance, and to display my current understanding of Vue.js. One of the major difficulties I found was updating the current active player (X vs. O) on the status bar. I blame my lack of syntax knowledge on this, as I could easily incorporate a listening/click event function to update the status bar utilizing vanilla javascript or jquery, but I'm looking forward to discussing this project and how I could have improved upon it!
